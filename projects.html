                <h1 class="center_text">Optum:</h1>
                <p> During my internship with Optum this past summer, 2022, I had the privillage of working with the Microsoft platform. My team was given the job of 
                    putting together a system to take information from a Microsoft SharePoint list, to a SQL table in the Optum database. To do this, the team used Power
                    Automate, a Microsoft application that allows connections between Microsoft softwares to be done automatically. By using Power Automate, the team was
                    able to draw all the list information in the Microsoft SharePoint, then copy that information to an SQL table in the database. It happened automatically,
                    which means when there was an update to the Microsoft SharePoint, the SQL table would also get updated, mimicing the Sharepoint list perfectly. This project
                    allowed the active Microsoft Sharepoint list to exist in an SQL table, that way other services that create reports can pull the SQL table information, and 
                    render the report with the new information. This was not possible to gather from Microsoft Sharepoint automatically.

                    with it! With CISC 130, I learned some of my first lines of code and I just knew that this was the career I wanted to go down. So, the image on the left is showing one

                    and to reverse an arrays contents. This class is truly what sparked my interest in computer science, to the point that I decided to change my major just a week in to the class.
                    Seeing this project just reminds me of the excitement I had when I realized the power and creativity of coding along with problem solving, meant endless possibilites!

                <p> In my third year of college, I had the opprotunity to take Web Development! This class developed foundational HTML and CSS skills, implementing JavaScript, call-back functions,
                    asynchronous usability, frameworks, API's, and more! The video below is a live demo of the final project for this course. This assignment was based on a dataset from crimes in St. Paul,
                    Minnesota. From this dataset, my team created an API to actively use the dataset for live interaction that would eventually come. Then, we had the opprotunity to use other API's such as 
                    Leaflet, which allowed the use of an active map. Other additional features came along with the project, and that is all explained in the video below! This was hands down one of the most unique
                    projects I was gifted the opprotunity to create, and it certainly was a hard but fun one!

                <p> In my second year of college, I took computer graphics! The following project, 3D Projections using wireframe drawing, was a fun yet complicated project! In the window below,
                    you are able to move in the scene using W, A, S, and D, as well as rotate the scene with the left and right arrow keys. This project demonstrates live rendering of translations
                    on three dimensional objects.

                <p> The project below, Shading and Illumination, focused on shading a scene with the Gouraud shading algorithm and the Phong shading algorithm. In the window below,
                    you are able to move in the scene using W, A, S, and D, as well as rotate the scene with the left and right arrow keys. Additionally, you are able to select how 
                    many light sources you would like. Default is 1, max is 10. You are able to change the location of each light source, as well as its color! All of this is done with live
                    rendering of the objects!

                <p> The project below, Fragment Shaders, was the last quick project for the CISC 420 course. The following clip is a goal scored in a game called Rocket League, a competitive car
                    soccer game. By using the buttons below, the scene can be changed to render as black and white, fish eye effect, ripple effect, toonify effect, and a custom effect. The custom 
                    effect changes and distorts the color over time. For the best result, reload the page, and then click on custom to see how it works. Additionally, there is a webcam feature to use
                    your webcam with all these effects!
