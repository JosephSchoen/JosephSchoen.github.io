                <h1>Snowboarding!</h1>
                <p>Ever since the 6th grade, I have been hooked with snowboarding. It makes the Minnesota winters so exciting! On top of that, I have had the opprotunity
                    to travel to the Rockies in the west. The picture on the left is in Beaver Creek, Colorado. I am in the red, and my two buddies, Hayden and Trevor, are middle
                    and right respectively. Click on the photo for more details about the resort!

                <h1>Ministry!</h1>
                <p>Ever since highschool, I have had the privilege of being involved in ministry within the church! It has been amazing walking with the Lord, doing it with my fellow
                    brother and sisters, and seeing God's faithfulness time and time again! It is something I cherish deeply is serving my community both within the church and outside
                    of the church, and is something I dedicate my time to each week!

                <h1>Weight Lifting!</h1>
                <p>Ever since 2018, I've found myself getting into the gym weekly! It is the best way for me to get my body moving, let my mind relax, and rest up mentally. It has
                    never been about my performance in the gym, it is all about spending time moving my body and resetting my mind. I love being physically active, and have found that
                    being active keeps me healthy not only physically, but also mentally, emotionally, and spiritually!
